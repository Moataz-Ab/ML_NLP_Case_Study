We believe that our technology will drive adoption of a next-generation dFMI where intermediaries are removed, incentive structures encourage self-regulation, and risks are mitigated and reduced to the maximum. dFMI doesn't just provide a cryptographically secure environment for market participants to transact, it provides a peer-to-peer model that removes financial intermediaries and engenders a wider ecosystem for value transfer across platforms and pre- post-trade processes. dFMI works to mitigate concentration and liquidity risk, reduce settlement cycles to real-time, remove friction, and lower the transaction cost of economic exchange. Clearmatics is a company with a strong belief in the open source movement and good ties to the Ethereum community. We also work closely with the Ethereum Foundation, and are an active member of the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance (EEA)."

5844,Ornim Medical,"Ornim Medical is an Israeli bio-medical high-technology company specializing in clinical research, development, and distribution of the highest quality medical devices for non-invasive patient monitoring specializing in the field of tissue and cerebral blood flow.  Its two products, the CerOx™ and the c-FLOW™, are bedside patient monitors based on the patented UTLight™ technology designed to provide physicians with unique monitoring solutions that are  imperative to individualized and personalized patient care.  Both products enable precise, real time, continuous and non-invasive measurements of cerebral blood flow alerting physicians to variations in blood flow to the brain, thus enabling informed intervention for better clinical results and patient care.  Ornim’s CerOx™ monitor is the only device in the market today enabling simultaneous, non-invasive measurement of both blood flow and oxygen saturation; while the c-FLOW™ is a pared down version used to measure the CBF only.   The use of either of these products (depending on the clinical setting) is key to understand perfusion while helping to direct treatment and lower the cost of patient care. Ornim’s unique technology, protected by 13 worldwide granted and 15 worldwide pending patents, overcome limitations of Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) and ultrasound Doppler. The patented UTLight™ technology employs the combination of light and ultrasound to provide a non-invasive measure of regional blood oxygen saturation and blood flow.   UTLight™ technology is unique among all other commercially available NIRS technologies, since it also analyzes the light speckle signal and does not rely solely on the intensity of light reaching the detector. Ornim Medical has developed a product range that was born out of a need – a need to measure blood flow directly.    In other words, the products have the capabilities of direct measurement of flow (not surrogate like tissue oximetry); they are intuitive and comprehensive; actionable; the management of blood pressure (BP) according to CBF is intuitive; the measurement is robust and finally they are when adding the BP signal, the Autoregulation function of the organ can be assessed directly."
6486,OrphoMed,"OrphoMed is a San Francisco Bay Area pharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel first-in-class therapeutic dimer conjugates based on its proprietary DIMERx™ platform technology. The company is leveraging its DIMERx™ technology to address the problem of visceral hypersensitivity and pancreatitis in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders and the unmet medical needs in the treatment of both peripheral neuropathic and systemic nociceptive pain.  The lead candidate ORP-101 is a peripherally acting sodium ion channel blocker (Nav 1.7), mu agonist/kappa antagonist dimer. The molecule does not cross the blood brain barrier and, unlike other opioids that constrict the sphincter of Oddi, ORP-101, when given intravenously in animal studies, has instead been shown to relax the sphincter. The former attribute implies no abuse potential and the latter minimizes the risks of pancreatitis and/or abdominal pain related to sphincter of Oddi constriction. These two attributes, in combination with the well-understood pharmacology of ORP-101, make the molecule a suitable candidate for chronic treatment of conditions associated with visceral and somatic hypersensitivity and hyperalgesia. Therefore we have positioned ORP-101 for two non-overlapping indications: the oral form for colonic hyperalgesia and gastric dysmotility in IBS-D and the parenteral form for the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain. The potential clinical benefits are backed by compelling data from validated animal models.  The company is also developing potent non-opioid and opioid conjugates to treat acute and chronic nociceptive pain. The non-opioid analgesic conjugate is designed to be non-ulcerogenic and liver-safe and, therefore, has the potential to reshape the pain market served by acetaminophen and NSAIDs. Similarly, the opioid conjugate is designed to be orally active and have a lower potential for dependence than currently available opioids.  DIMERx™ technology results in conjugates designed to preserve the receptor pharmacology of their individual constituents, but to have therapeutic profiles well suited for different clinical indications. The components of the conjugates have all been previously proven to be safe and effective for other indications and, therefore, the conjugates have reduced developmental risks. The DIMERx™ conjugates are considered to be new molecular entities and have composition of matter intellectual property protection."

MARKET OPPORTUNITY In the U.S. there are over 10.8 million medium- and heavy-duty on-road commercial vehicles that consume 39 billion gallons of diesel fuel annually and account for 23% of transportation sector greenhouse gas emissions. ,   In Canada, these figures are 1.1 million, 13 billion, and 70% respectively.  Fuel costs are the second largest operating expense of a fleet, after labor, accounting for roughly 40% of all costs.   Fleets are aggressively seeking solutions to reduce fuel costs, even fractions of a percent, because the bottom-line impact is so substantial. Optimus enables fleets to reduce fuel costs by at least 10%, utilize domestically produced fuel and reduce greenhouse gas emissions while allowing a fleet of 100 trucks to save at least $800,000 in annual fuel costs. Of these 11.9 million trucks, approximately 3 million are currently operating on a low biodiesel blend .  This early customer segment represents a beachhead market opportunity of $30 billion.

The basic objective in structural analysis and design is to produce a structure capable of resisting all applied loads without failure during its intended life. Structural Engineers typically use various software solutions (same as the architects use autocad for example) such as ETABS, SAP2000 etc. After the structural engineers finish their design, OptiStructure connects to their software, takes the output and optimizes it against any variable. Most frequently the optimisation is done against cost. So far the minimum optimisation that has taken place is 10% from our solution and the maximum 37%. Imagine in a building of a skyscraper for example worth 100s millions saving even 10% is a huge number.

7036,Property Detective,"Property Detective was founded in 2011 as the result of a home purchase that went badly wrong.In May 2010, Property Detective’s founder, Barry Bridges, finally got onto the property ladder and moved into a family home with his (then) fiancée. Over the course of the next year, however, he learnt the hard way that in spite of the surveys, searches, checks and questions asked, sometimes not everything is what it seemed.In October 2011 he teamed up with Jack Waley-Cohen and a well-respected developer to build a prototype tool that helped homeowners find out whether their new home would be within range of church bells; together, they took the very first version of Property Detective to Seedcamp, where they were a London finalist in 2012 and invited back to the investment committee (but didn’t get investment).In April 2012 they secured a significant tranche of angel investment and set about building the first ‘proper’ version of Property Detective, which launched on the day of the opening ceremony for the London 2012 Olympic games. This was swiftly followed by more investment and a major re-launch in March 2013 with the site that you can see today.Over the past 3 and a bit years the site has grown and grown and grown…alongside the team of dedicated, innovative and entrepreneurial developers, statisticians, project managers and economists around it. We are very confident in calling ourselves the market leader in consumer property research and are very pleased that our reports have been recognised by COPSO as being of such a high standard that they qualify for PCCB accreditation (which is something usually reserved for the ‘official’ searches that a solicitor does during the conveyancing process).Slowly, but surely, Property Detective is changing the way that people move home. We’re helping people make more informed, smarter decisions about where they want to live, by giving them the complete picture – warts and all – as to what a property, street or neighbourhood can offer them and their lifestyle, from schools, crime rates, demographics, flightpaths, noise and smell nuisances, retail and leisure opportunities, broadband speeds and much more.

Our products are used by system integrator partners and by system manufacturers who benefit from the unique characteristics of our sensors — namely small size, low cost, unattended operation, and the ability to detect a broad range of threats with a single, standard sensor configuration.  The company was founded in 2004 to commercialize a unique sensor technology developed at the University of Nevada, Reno. Early R&D was supported by DARPA, the DOD, and the Department of Homeland Security. NevadaNano has now turned its focus to commercial applications, specifically, the Internet of Things (IOT).  NevadaNano is uniquely positioned to address a broad range of sensor applications. Vapors from bio-agents have been successfully detected, as have chemicals representative of illicit drugs and human respiration. The greatest impact from chemical, explosive, and bio-sensors will only be felt when they can be deployed ubiquitously in large numbers and over wide areas. This will only happen when sensors are small and affordable, can sense a very broad range of substances, and are robust enough to operate unattended for long periods of time. The core element of NevadaNano’s sensor modules and systems is manufactured on a solid-state, MEMS technology, offering small size, low cost, and high reliability. The sensing element is an array of MEMS structures that are not only self-activating and self-sensing, they are also self-cleaning and self-calibrating, thus enabling unattended deployment for extended periods. Using proprietary materials as well as unique sensing methods and analysis techniques, a single sensor configuration is able to detect hundreds of diverse types of vapors and particles. These advantages make our Molecular Property Spectrometer™ (MPS™) solution the leading candidate to fulfill the vision of ubiquitous sensor deployment for both homeland security and commercial applications."

By exposing the saturated plastic to enough heat to soften it rather than melt it, the gas will nucleate into billions of bubbles, and be held in place by the solid state plastic.  Eight years ago our founders realized that applying this technology to the most recycled plastic on earth would result in dramatic impacts in the sustainability.  On September 11, 2002, MicroGREEN Polymers was incorporated in Washington State.  The ''Micro'' part of our name is an abbreviation of microcellular technology, while ''green'' connotes the eco-friendly nature of that technology.  When the company was formed, the founders, Greg Branch and Krishna Nadella, were working on their PhDs at the University of Washington in the field of microcellular polymer manufacturing.

5449,Veniti,"VENITI is the first medical device company developing a suite of innovative technology and solutions that will provide comprehensive treatment across the venous disease continuum.  Venous disease refers to all conditions related to or caused by veins that become diseased or abnormal. This encompasses a broad set of maladies. The venous disease cycle begins when vein walls become weak or damaged, or the valves are stretched or injured, and can no longer prevent reflux (backward flow of blood). Once the veins lose their ability to convey blood without reflux, the progressive venous disease cycle has begun. This is commonly referred to as chronic venous insufficiency, or CVI. The blood will begin to back up into the peripheral veins, causing venous hypertension, potential thrombosis (clotting), and leading to even more damage of the vein walls and valves. This in turn leads to more reflux.  The VENITI team of experts in science, technology and business are currently developing the VENITI VICI VENOUS STENT® System. Through this, and other, innovative technology, VENITI will achieve results that sets it apart in addressing the challenges specific to the venous system and venous disease."

We are an online community for connecting Homebuyers with neighborhood information beyond just stats and figures. Here, you can find the answers to questions like: How hard is it to get into a good school? Is it safe to play in the parks? Are there any good health food stores nearby? Is there a neighborhood recreation center? What is that new development down the street, and how will it impact my property value? Answers and information is provided by other members of the community, including residents and real estate professionals, who have lived and worked in the neighborhood - often times, for decades. Another challenge we’re committed to overcoming is that of selecting the right real estate professional who will advocate for you and hold your hand through the biggest purchasing decision of your life. Too many people select an agent from a flier, bus stop billboard, or shopping cart ad. Then you’re swept up and pressured into a relationship with someone you don’t necessarily gel with. What if you had the opportunity to get to know agents before deciding who to give commission to? WikiRealty allows you to explore expert insight, ask and answer questions, develop a relationship via direct messaging and text messages, and see what other professionals the agent has in their network who can help complete the process - from inspection, through title insurance, local landscapers, possible legal referrals, and potential construction contacts. Your kids will go to school and play in this neighborhood. The people here will be your neighbors for years to come. They say you don’t choose your family, but you can choose where you live and how your kids will grow up. At WikiRealty, we provide you the chance to meet and get to know your potential future friends and neighbors before even moving in."

Printed Electronic Technology makes sophisticated devices accessible to everyone, and it takes beyond the classic electronics industry.   This technology, also called TOLAE (Thin, Organic and Large Area Electronics), allows a wide range of electrical and electronic components to be produced by printing processes, using techniques similar to those used in the graphic arts.  The current development of printed electronics makes it very suitable for the manufacture of certain parts of an electronic circuit. By printing technology is highly desirable manufacturing the conductive traces of the circuit and some basic components thereof, such as resistors, capacitors, and diodes, among others. But this technology has not yet achieved such print transistors miniaturization and high performance as the traditional electronics, such as in the case of a microcontroller.  VIVAINNOVA noted the opportunity to unite the advantages provided by both technologies to create their hybrid technology called UFPC (Ultra Flexible Printed Circuits), thus exploiting the competitive advantages of both technologies.

5854,Bird Cycleworks,"Bird Cycleworks is a bicycle manufacturing company that offers its products online. It was founded in 2013 and is based in Hook, East Riding of Yorkshire, United Kingdom.  Bird is the brainchild of Ben Pinnick & Dan Hodge, fanatical MTBers with a long history of riding and racing. The third founder is Dave Cutts, who is the financial expert at Bird, together with ensuring the smooth running of this great business.  They wanted to build bikes how they build them for ourselves, not just models designed to fill in a range. They knew to do this they’d need to rethink everything they knew about bikes, and come up with their way of doing things.  To make this vision come true they’re not just making bikes, they’re changing the way everything works. From using just in time manufacturing techniques, local sourced parts as much as possible, assembling everything in the UK, ditching the idea of model years and releasing bikes just when they’re ready. Everything about Bird is different.    At bird they don’t have any catalogue frames. For those of you who don’t know what they mean, a catalogue frame is one which is produced by a manufacturer and then rebadged a dozen times for other brands. Every Bird bike is designed from the ground up by us. In order to keep the price of their bikes keen, they sell direct from their north Hampshire factory.  Their ethos is simple:  Build great bikes that will stand up to the rigors of trail riding, while offering a totally sorted handling bike. They don’t want to build the lightest XC bikes, there’s alot of those about already, they’re building trail bikes and they’re proud of it.  They focus first on the ride, second on the whole package, and never on the ‘marketing ploy’. You won’t find rear mech upgrades on their bikes, or sneaky downgrades in components you probably don’t know or look too closely at until they let you down. Every component on every Bird is one they’d personally be 100% happy riding for the rest of their lives."

This level of customer, order and product detail is normally not available until well into the dispute process. With Chargeback’s Real-time Resolution feature, it becomes the first line of defense and stops the dispute from ever becoming a chargeback.  Improving Your Dispute Win Rate with Best Practices and Expertise  The Chargeback App is used to manage all types of disputes and facilitates quick and comprehensive response generation for all categories of disputes including, Fraud, Authorization, Processing Errors, and Cardholder Disputes. Much of the response data will auto-populate from connected data sources into contextual evidence blocks written to address and adhere to the network’s rules and regulations. The Chargeback App guides users through the addition of required and/or supplemental compelling evidence based on the network reason code, transaction type and any applicable transaction modifiers to ensure the best possible responses are provided to the issuer and ensuring the highest possible win-rates. Reducing Time Spent Managing Disputes  Identifying and gathering the data required to respond to a single dispute traditionally requires logging into several separate systems, including OMS, CRM, ERP, fraud filters, shipping vendors and multiple PSPs (gateways, processors, networks). By consolidating the data from each, the Chargeback App eliminates the excessive time traditionally spent dealing with a dispute. By programming the dispute rules set forth by each network (Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover) your team no longer needs to research and understand the nuances of reason codes, transaction modifiers and exceptions necessary to properly respond to disputes. The Chargeback App provides expert guidance and support at every stage of the dispute lifecycle to ensure the recovery of lost revenue."

7327,Building Patterns,"How is it possible that my 10-year-old nephew creates an empire during an hour in his game program, while designing a family house lasts for several days and is done by more than architect?  Why can an architectural design software be used only by those people who already have the necessary knowledge gained in a special course?  The main problem is that it is too difficult to use the architectural design software and its performance can sometimes less as optimal. These systems are outdated. They were developed 40-50 years ago for a bunch of experts.   The solution is the Building Patterns. It is very simple to use the Building Patterns. It is enough to be familiar with Windows and to know how to use a right-button menu. A com-plete building model can be made by some clicks. As the model is ready, one can order the complete design documentation which is produced automatically by the system. Thus in case of a family house the whole design process is shortened to half an hour."

5816,CapRally,"CapRally is building an Freemium platform for companies, investors, and investment bankers to easily manage their capital raising opportunities.  Users can get matched with investors, manage and track the investors within the deal, and collaborate on that deal with their team or advisors. Eventually the shared data analytics and reporting will help with investor insight.  Competitive Advantage over Spreadsheets and CRM: 1) Integration - CRM fails when it takes you away from your workflow.  General purpose CRMs like Streak.com are trying to solve this by building into your email client (in their case GMail), CapRally will need to build these ties in order to get real usage, which will in turn produce quality data to run analytics on; 2) General Purpose vs. Focused on Fundraising - Most CRMs are focused on their core user (sales people) and the software data structures are locked into that.  Because of this, users have to change their process to match the system rather than the system matching their process.  Salesforce has created instances (VC and Investment Bank) which renames the fields and objects, but it is putting lipstick on a sales system. 3) Too Complicated - Despite claiming to want every bell and whistle, when met with a million things to customize, people's eyes glaze over and they go back to what they know. 4) High Price Point - because some of the groups that have previously gone after the market started at times when SAAS or Freemium models didn't exist and had to hire enterprise sales teams, the business could only be supported by huge prices tags.  That model limits the amount of users and overall market to just the funds willing to pay for it.  The interesting thing is that more deals are done away from funds as well as away from investment banks (7 out of 8).  With a Freemium model, we can capture all the deals and the data along with it and create premium features that we can charge the high-end users."

Nevertheless, the megatrends like Big Data or the Internet of Things offer great opportunities for the future development of the construction sector. Prerequisite for the successful Construction 4.0 is the creation of a digital twin of a construction site. CIM (Construction/Civil Information Modeling) enables architects and planners to come together and work on a set of 3D models. This in return, creates an interactive project which promotes real-time collaboration. When the architects and engineers are collaborating, planning and sharing the information of the project, they are effectively employing CIM. Through the use of CIM, projects of any scale are able to be constructed, this could be something as small as an individual building to a full-fledged town. CIM’s ability to offer improved results at a lower cost is what drives the change from traditional methods in the industry. Along the total life cycle from design to construction, operation and maintenance towards remodeling or demolition, the digital twin follows all modifications of the real construction site and dynamically readjusts itself in case of recorded performance differences. Thus, for the whole lifespan of the real construction site, performance predictions generated with the virtual twin represent an accurate basis for well-informed decisions. DigitalTwin Technology is a construction technology company operating out of Cologne Germany. DigitalTwin Technology is the first company in the world to make use of VR and AR for digital twin in the tunneling segment of the construction industry for CIM (Construction/Civil Information Modeling).

Allow real estate professionals to continue doing their job, compete for commissions, separate the weak from the strong, and allow consumers to benefit.

View, in real time, who is commenting on what property, what they are saying, and how good they are at it.  Next baby step - allow users to transact real estate from their mobile device, in real time. Submit an offer, chat with the seller or agent, receive a counter-offer, and work toward an accepted purchase contract, all done within minutes, instead of days.

Setup a to-do list for each party and a timeline. Monitor, in real time, who is responsible for what action, and when that action will be complete. Sign documents, complete addendums, review reports, revise terms, and close the transaction. All of this will be done from any device, from anywhere in the world.

6490,Idro Meccanica,"Idro Meccanica compressors are hydraulically driven. The oil and the gas sections are separated by a short single-compartment distance piece vented to the atmosphere. The vent lines for oil and gas could be collected and checked from time to time to control the status of the seals. The gas section is non-lubricated and due to the separation and the double seals, the oil carry-over is virtually none. The flexibility of the hydraulic system helps in having compressors and boosters that could accept a wide range of inlet pressures. Some of our units could also be used as compressor/boosters to fill and then intake gas from a high-pressure storage in order to achieve high flow-rate in a direct fill. The booster compressor is also the most suitable solution for daughter refueling stations as they do not need to reduce the pressure from the mobile storages being able to accept a wide inlet pressure range. Idro Meccanica compressors could have a maximum of five stages in one cylinder. The best-sold models are two and three stage compressors/boosters. Most of the units could also be supplied in twin version with two compressors assembled on the same frame in order to reduce installation space. The twin solution could also be used with two different models in order to combine a booster with a low-pressure compressor. The selection of the correct model is usually carried-out together with the potential customer taking into consideration the type of gas, available inlet pressure, required outlet pressure and rate of flow. Most of the units could be tailored to the customers’ needs with just small modifications from our main PED certified standard models (more than 50)."

7480,Pleasant Green Grass,"Pleasant Green Grass has grown “organically” from its local Durham, NC roots to become the region’s largest and longest running organic lawn care company. Pleasant Green Grass was founded by Scott Walker in the community of Pleasant Green Durham, NC.   After graduating from NC State University, Scott studied the science of fertilization, weed control, and the threats regularly used pesticides and other chemicals pose to people, pets and the environment. Scott moved out west to train and work for four years with an organic lawn care company. The experience of working with an established organic lawn care company helped him to combine his study of the science of environmentally friendly lawn care with excellent business practices and knowledge of what customers really want.  Scott created a safe and natural customized program for organic lawn care that avoids the conventional hazardous substances, produces better performing lawns and the best part is that he offers these services at about the same price as conventional “chemical” lawn companies. Scott, and Pleasant Green Grass, has developed proprietary and completely unique fertilization and weed control methods specific to the typical North Carolina clay soil.   After testing the program with strong results and happy customers, Scott returned to the community of Pleasant Green to begin Pleasant Green Grass Organic Lawn Care. Referrals from satisfied customers helped grow the company to one of the largest organic lawn care companies in the state. The current use and abuse of synthetic pesticides by the lawn care industry have been shown to potentially cause cancer, birth defects and pollute our water ways is alarming and in large part unnecessary. The lack of science-based decisions taken by most lawn care programs and lack of knowledge is also problematic. The natural and organic alternative to chemical herbicides and pesticides exists and has been used for generations with excellent results. We take the health and safety of our employees, our customers and their babies, children and families, our pets and wildlife extremely seriously. We are TRULY all-natural and organic (certified organic whenever possible), committed to excellent customer service, getting the job done right and making this world and the North Carolina Triangle region just a little bit healthier and more sustainable. Pleasant Green Grass ONLY uses all-natural and organic products making them safe for babies, children and families, pets and our employees.   Pleasant Green Grass is a company that has grown the right way with good, knowledgeable people.  Our integrity and concern for the environment, and for creating healthy ecosystems, in our lawns and elsewhere is genuine and what keeps us passionate about our work. Scott believes that all employees of Pleasant Green Grass should have the knowledge and training to satisfy our customers. Pleasant Green Grass takes pride in our employees and we work to hire the best possible people. Our technicians are experienced, trained in the use of organic applications and friendly! Scott thinks it’s important to provide a safe and enjoyable atmosphere for all employees and we work hard to do so. We are always open to feedback and work hard to establish a personal relationship with all of our customers."
