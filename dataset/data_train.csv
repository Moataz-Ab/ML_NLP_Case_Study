799,WiZN Systems,"We are a bunch of passionate engineers who are challenging the status quo. We believe that the existing low power wireless standards are not sufficient to bring the IoT revolution with 50+ Billion devices connected to the Internet. Some of the challenges with the existing technologies are: reliability of wireless communication in harsh environmental conditions; ultra low power communication budget to extend battery life and the cost of internet connectivity. We are trying to address these problems with our technology. Our stand on the IoT standardization debate is simple. The last mile connectivity can not be standardized! The reason being, unlike Internet, the IoT applications are very different. Turning on a bulb requires just one ‘bit’ versus streaming video needs data rates of the order of Mbits/sec. Hence multiple standard-based and proprietary solutions will have to co-exist to address these wide varieties of applications. And this is possible only when standardization happens at the cloud level. This will allow all the connected things to talk to each other, irrespective of their last mile communication protocol. Our endeavour is to showcase this approach with our technology and products. Consumers don’t care about the standards. They care about the experience, utility and cost.

For example, the system can send SMS to parents when their child arrives from school, and transmit information to integrated systems via available APIs. It could be a smart house management platform that will send a command to warm up food in the microwave.

728,iGeolise (TravelTime platform),"The TravelTime platform locates, ranks & sorts points of interest by travel time, not distance. Consumer-facing websites or apps can access the platform via an API, then their users can find the geographic content they want, using the travel time and transport mode of their choice. For example, an estate agent’s site can ‘show suitable houses within 45 minutes commute by public transport, to arrive by 09.00’ and a restaurant site could ‘show restaurants within a 20 minute walk of my hotel’. TravelTime typically doubles the number of relevant results, when compared to a ‘within X miles’ distance-based search. iGeolise was formed in 2009 when Charlie had the idea that it was more useful to find content on the web by the time it takes to travel there, rather than by distance. Since then, Charlie and our team of smart developers have built the TravelTime platform that ‘turns distance into time’.",PropTech

Branch takes a D2C approach to a huge B2B industry, removing these vendors from the process with an easy to use, transparently priced e-commerce platform. Beyond making the furniture more affordable and the process of getting it easier, Branch is the first company to create a flexible office furniture experience, allowing companies to return their furniture for credits once they're done with it.

474,Simplifa,"The PropTech startup Simplifa offers real estate owners an all-round service in the area of elevator management with the help of smart building and Internet of Things technologies and already manages more than 1,000 elevator systems today. Elevators are a pain point for their owners: The operation and maintenance costs of the elevator generate some of the highest costs per square feet in the property and elevator downtimes cause extreme user dissatisfaction, high administrative burden for property managers and can even lead to justified rent reductions. Implementing operational obligations, such as maintenance, documentation and repair, lies in the primary responsibility of the property owners. However, due to high cost and often lack of expertise, this happens usually not only inefficiently, but also involves legal risks, for example due to failure to employ maintenance measures. In addition, there is a high information asymmetry between owner / property manager and elevator maintenance company, which often leads to disproportionately high maintenance costs. Simplifa structures, optimizes, and manages elevator portfolios for its customers. The startup serves as a central point of contact for owners and elevator service companies and acts as an expert on an equal footing in negotiations. Each elevator undergoes a technical inspection and is recorded in 360° shots to simulate a virtual “elevator twin”. In the event of system malfunctions, the maintenance company can ensure a much faster and more targeted repair thanks to the ''elevator twin'' without prior dispatch of a technician. Thanks to Simplifa, the operating and maintenance costs of the elevators are regularly reduced by about 30% while maintaining the same quality. In the future, the transmission of sensor data will provide a manufacturer-independent real-time analysis for a predictive maintenance system, which will reduce the manual test frequency of the elevators and avoid costly downtimes in advance.",PropTech

272,Soft Robotics,"The business end of a robotic arm is the gripper. The March 2105 edition of Modern Materials Handling best describes the challenge when they wrote: “Perhaps more than any other element of robotic development in warehousing and distribution, the end-of-arm tooling, or gripper, is the place that can make or break a robot’s success.”  Advancing gripper technology is the key to unlocking a new age of automation. An age where they can automate tote pick and pack for grocery distribution, bin picking of soft and delicate parts, e-commerce order fulfillment, fruit harvesting, luggage handling, and consumer goods packaging. The US fresh produce packing market alone represents a $27 billion retail market searching for automation solutions. Soft Robotics has demonstrated the ability to bring robotic product handling and packaging to this market.  These are problems of adaptability, complexity, and cost. The search for a more adaptable gripper has driven up the complexity of design to devices like servo grippers and complicated tool changing requirements. This complexity comes at a high price in gripper cost, the need for larger arms, and complex software and hardware integration.  Their revolutionary soft robotic technology, covered by more than 40 patents and applications, enables us to design and manufacture soft robotic hands that address the new unstructured world of automation and logistics. Through their propriety knowledge of actuator geometry, material selection, and operating envelope, they can tune actuators to be force limiting with NO CLOSED LOOP FEEDBACK system required. Soft Robotics brings the highest level of adaptability, while lowering system complexity and total system cost. The adaptive nature of their technology allows a single grasper to handle an unprecedented range of objects, regardless of shape, size, or weight, with no tool or software changes between cycles. We’ve demonstrated the ability to grasp bags of rice, raw food, bars of soap, boxes of toothpaste, and clothing all with a single device.  But soft does not mean weak. Their technology has the ability to scale from the smallest to the largest task. The result is an automation solution that can pack a tote for retail distribution, pick fruit off the vine, or easily handle a ten pound kettle bell.  They have demonstrated the speed and precision necessary to integrate into the factories and warehouses of today and the future, operating at speeds up to 130 picks per minute.Their system is plug and play with the most common industrial robots using industry standard protocols and vision systems.They have designed the system to be “robot and vision agnostic,” allowing the system to quickly and seamlessly integrate with the full range of robots, from small collaborative systems to high speed industrial packing cells.  Soft Robotics launched their industrial product at Automate 2015 in March 2015, Their produce handling system in June 2015, and started shipping in June 2015. They are now selling systems to their pilot customers. Soft Robotics is foundational technology that solves the problems of today and unlocks the future of automation.",ManufacturingTech

743,Elephantech,"Elephantech is a startup company that aims to drastically innovate the technology for manufacturing electronic circuits, with the vision of achieving faster manufacturing at lower cost by leveraging printing technology.Electronic circuits are literally part of social infrastructures and are embedded everywhere in the world that we live in today. While the number and types of electronic devices being used by humans have been increasing dramatically, driven by advances in semiconductor and telecommunication technology, the technology for manufacturing electronic circuits has not seen any major innovation over the past 50 years. Conventional electronic circuits are manufactured through a process called photolithography, which involves applying metal all over the surface of a substrate and melting the metal off any unrequired areas. However, photolithography has the disadvantage of wasting large amounts of the materials used and driving up the production cost, in addition to being harmful to the environment. Elephantech’s suggested manufacturing method, which is a totally opposite approach to photolithography, involves printing metal only onto the required areas using inkjet printing and enlarging the printed metal by applying plating technology. This approach has enabled Elephantech to manufacture PWBs at significantly lower cost as the amounts of materials required and the number of processes have been reduced. In addition, as this is an on-demand manufacturing solution that does not require any initial cost, it is cost-effective especially for producing prototypes in small quantities, the cost of which can be reduced by at least 80%. We currently possess the best technology in the world for manufacturing PWBs using inkjet printers, the business of which is slated to expand rapidly going forward.

3102,DropWise Technologies,"DropWise Technologies Corp. is commercializing a breakthrough coating technology, including advanced durable materials and unique vapor-based deposition processes developed in collaboration between two leading MIT labs, to solve problems of fouling and corrosion in heat exchange equipment. By applying its innovative ultra-thin and durable coating solutions, DropWise serves enormous markets that were previously inaccessible by conventional coating technologies. Heat exchangers are a crucial part of every thermal fluid system, from the intercoolers and radiators used to cool cars and trucks, to the condensers and evaporators that drive HVAC/R equipment, to the massive boilers and condensers that drive manufacturing processes and power plants. They rely on very thin heat transfer surfaces that are extremely sensitive to fouling and corrosion, which creates a process bottleneck and forces operators to either reduce output capacity, consume more energy to compensate, or shut down completely to clean the affected heat exchanger.  For all of these problems, conventional liquid-based anti-fouling and anti-corrosion coatings are too thick, and often make the problem worse by insulating the heat transfer surfaces. Faced with this unacceptable performance tradeoff, the status quo is to leave the equipment uncoated and to bear the significant costs of the fouling and corrosion that inevitably occur. Using an innovative vapor-based deposition process, DropWise coatings are chemically grafted to virtually any surface and built up to precise thicknesses. The chemical grafting provides an extremely durable bond that has surpassed testing under severe industrial conditions, and the coating thicknesses can be tuned to nanometer precision to be hundreds of times thinner than conventional coatings. DropWise has secured a license to the MIT patent applications, and is developing a coating platform built from a wide library of precursor materials to address different applications. Low surface energy coatings are used to break up insulating films of condensate into droplets, enabling a 7x increase in heat transfer that allows the coating to boost the efficiency of a wide range of processes, from steam power generation and desalination to HVAC/R and chemical processing; while another chemically inert formulation is used to protect against corrosive environments.",ManufacturingTech

With Zunum Aero, simply drive to a nearby airfield and walk to your aircraft with bags in tow, for a trip that will take half the time and at a much lower fare. Or skip the meeting altogether, and be on the slopes in Tahoe by 8:40 AM for $100 round-trip, and back home the same evening. We are a land of towns and communities, many with airports, but few with regular air service. Our stock of 13,500 airports is the largest in the world, yet just 140 of the largest hubs carry over 97% of air traffic. This has left many of us with long drives to catch a flight, while on shorter trips we skip air travel altogether. Communities without good air service also struggle to attract investment and create jobs. Electric aircraft of varying sizes are ideally suited to this critical need, requiring little support other than a GPS flight path and a quick recharge or swap facility on the tarmac. Be it Moses Lake, Beaumont, Santa Fe or Butte: prepare for the convenience of frequent electric air service. Did you know that short-haul flights produce over 40% of aviation emissions? With our aircraft, we believe these will be largely eliminated within twenty years.

The layers are separated using a dielectric material, typically polyester or polypropylene. When connected to a power source, a charge is distributed along the upstream electrode which then transfers a charge to the downstream electrode by capacitive coupling. Unlike a conventional cable, there is no direct conductive connection between source and load. The CTS can be designed to have a specific capacitance value, which allows it to overcome the inductance problem inherent in all existing cables and also to contribute extra capacitance by design, benefiting the whole electrical system.",ManufacturingTech

768,Green Plug,"Green Plug brings about a much needed revolution in the way we power electronic products. Today, dozens of consumer electronics (CE products) require external power adapters and battery chargers. Unfortunately, there is no common interface that will provide for interoperability and reusability, convenience, savings and the reduction of unnecessary components that wind up as eWaste because power adapters are normally thrown away when they are in perfect working condition. That's not sustainable. That's poor economics. And, Green Plug has changed this for the better. Green Plug is the first developer of digital technology that enables real-time collaboration between electronic devices and their power sources. Billions of devices including laptops, printers, speakers, routers, modems, cell phones, entertainment devices, power tools, cameras and so many other portable electronic devices require a power source that converts between 90V and 254V wall power to device-specific DC power. That means that these devices require unique power converters, and that is very costly, is extremely inconvenient and contributes to wasted resources and pollution. Greentalk(TM)-enabled intelligent power supplies, however, communicate with electronic devices and negotiate device power requirements for all devices connected to them. All cables and connectors are uniform; so, they work with any device! Being intelligent power sources, they eliminate wasted ''phantom power'' (power that is wasted when chargers are plugged in and either connected to devices that are fully charged or have no devices connected to them.) Greentalk provides an API for power monitoring and reporting applications as well as advanced control built upon 2-way communication.",ManufacturingTech

Loxo Oncology is committed to bringing targeted cancer therapies rapidly into the clinic that have an opportunity for outsized clinical effects in genetically defined patient populations. Loxo Oncology derives its company name from an attendant of the Greek goddess Artemis, who represented the concept of trajectory in the sport of archery. It is an exciting time to develop cancer drugs. Diagnostic methods are yielding strong clues about which cancer features are actionable, “driver mutations,” in contrast to those merely along for the ride as “passenger mutations.” In the last five years, these insights have transformed the standard of care in melanoma, lung cancer and other cancers. Picking a target is just the first step in building a cancer drug. Good chemists build good drugs. The physical properties of a compound have much to do with its ultimate success or failure. Is it stable? Is it soluble? Is it absorbed? Does it reach its target? Does it engage the target? Does it cause toxicity elsewhere in the body before it achieves maximum efficacy in the cancer? In our opinion, drugs that achieve excellent exposure in the body and are highly specific for their intended targets have the highest chances of success. Once an attractive target is selected and a drug with best-in-class properties is constructed, setting up the right clinical development plan is of utmost importance. Our goal is to generate a clinical path that reflects the underlying scientific hypothesis that made the drug interesting in the first place. This often means developing the drug in a population of patients whose tumors possess a specific genetic vulnerability targeted by the drug. Loxo Oncology was built around a team of full-time professionals and engaged scientific advisors who are aligned in choosing the most actionable targets, and pursuing them through disciplined clinical trial approaches. Our license and collaboration agreement with Array Biopharma and our experienced team allows us to construct drugs with best-in-class properties from the ground up.",Health & Life Science Tech

In 2004, the company was incorporated and the first flagship center was opened in Herzliya, Israel. Nine years and countless Pertupods later, with over 50,000 patients treated worldwide, AposTherapy now has 11 centers available in four countries (US, UK, Israel and Singapore). AposTherapy is a personalized program for the treatment of various orthopedic conditions, which utilizes an individually calibrated, patent protected, foot-worn biomechanical device. The treatment is delivered by specially-trained physical therapists and is carried out during the patient’s normal daily activities, at home or at work, for about an hour a day to enable optimal results. The aim of AposTherapy is to address the biomechanical abnormalities that are characteristic of various orthopaedic conditions – the body's mal-alignment, muscle weakness, impaired neuromuscular control and the resulted abnormal pathological movement patterns. The ultimate goal of the treatment is to promote and restore desired motor patterns. Our philosophy is to empower patients by enhancing their understanding of their condition and the underlying causes of their symptoms. This knowledge, combined with a personalized treatment modality, allows the patient to take active control over their therapy and progress. Their progress is closely monitored and clinical outcomes are shared with the patients so they have an objective measurement of their improvement.  The principles of applying a scientific approach to everything we do is at the core of, and instilled into, the very essence of AposTherapy. To date, we have many collaborative research papers published in independent peer-reviewed journals. We welcome all opportunities to learn and understand more about the various musculoskeletal diseases and their pathophysiologies, manifestations, and how AposTherapy and its partners can jointly improve the quality of life of those affected.",Health & Life Science Tech

2513,Sierra Oncology,"Sierra Oncology is a clinical stage drug development company advancing targeted therapeutics for the treatment of patients with cancer. We are an ambitious oncology-focused company, oriented towards achieving the successful registration and commercialization of our product candidates. We have a highly experienced management team with a proven track record of success in oncology drug development and we are advancing an emerging pipeline of next generation therapies that target the DNA Damage Response (DDR) network. Our lead product candidate, SRA737, is a potent, highly selective, orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of Checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1). Chk1 is a key regulator of cell cycle progression and the DDR replication response. In cancer cells, intrinsic replication stress is induced by factors such as oncogenes (e.g., MYC or CCNE1), genetic mutations in DNA repair machinery (e.g., BRCA1 or FA), genetic mutations leading to a dysregulated cell cycle (e.g., TP53 or RAD50) or other genomic alterations. This replication stress results in persistent DNA damage and genomic instability leading to an increased dependency on Chk1 for survival. Targeted inhibition of Chk1 by SRA737 may therefore be synthetically lethal to cancer cells with elevated intrinsic replication stress and have utility as a monotherapy in a range of tumor indications. The combination of SRA737 with other modalities, such as other agents that target the DDR network and certain chemotherapeutics, may also provide synergistic anti-tumor activity via a variety of potential biological mechanisms. Importantly, the oral bioavailability of SRA737 may afford greater dosing flexibility for both monotherapy and combination therapy settings than is possible with intravenously administered agents. We are pursuing an innovative development plan for SRA737, which is currently being evaluated in two Phase 1/2 clinical trials in patients with advanced cancer. SRA737-01 is intended to evaluate SRA737’s potential to induce synthetic lethality as monotherapy, while the SRA737-02 is intended to evaluate the combination of SRA737 potentiated by subtherapeutic, low dose gemcitabine. Concurrently, we are conducting preclinical research evaluating SRA737 in combination with other DDR-targeted agents, including poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, as well as with immuno-oncology therapeutics, that may guide a potential next wave of clinical development for our asset, possibly further broadening its therapeutic utility. We are also advancing SRA141, a potent, selective, orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of cell division cycle 7 kinase (Cdc7). Cdc7 is a key regulator of DNA replication and is involved in the DDR network, making it a compelling emerging target for potential treatment across a broad range of tumor types. SRA141 is currently undergoing preclinical research in preparation for an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) expected in late 2018.

2907,Metabolomic Diagnostics,"Metabolomic Diagnostics Ltd., is collaborating with University College Cork, Ireland, (UCC) and the Cork University Maternity Hospital (CUMH) on the development of groundbreaking predictive pregnancy diagnostics. Their predictive diagnostic tests have the potential to transform maternal and fetal care globally, delivering on both of the key drivers in healthcare: improved quality of care and reduced costs.  Pre-eclampsia is a disease of late pregnancy characterised by the concomitant occurrence of hypertension (high blood pressure) and proteinuria (elevated protein in the urine) leading to restricted blood supply to the foetus. The condition begins in early pregnancy with defective development of the placenta but most often does not manifest itself until the second half of pregnancy. Once diagnosed, the only treatment option is the delivery of the baby prematurely. Latest research shows that the condition has been the most significant cause of maternal death over recent decades and is responsible for occupancy of approximately 20% of neonatal intensive care unit cots. Between 70,000 and 80,000 women die every year from pre-eclampsia and in excess of half a million new born infants die annually as a direct result of the condition.  Identification of first time mothers at risk for these conditions is the first step to effective intervention and prevention. Prenatal care currently consists of a series of consultations during pregnancy with a doctor or midwife. The main reason for these checks is to detect early signs of hypertension and proteinuria. The standard intervals between prenatal visits may result in delays in diagnosis with an increased chance of severe complications. If at risk first time mothers could be identified in early pregnancy, known and emerging therapies could potentially prevent or treat the condition. In the US alone the cost of prenatal care associated with pre-eclampsia is over $7 billion. The World Health Organization recently concluded that there is currently no cost effective or reliable screening test for pre-eclampsia. As a consequence, clinicians are unable to offer either targeted surveillance or potential preventative therapies to those at risk.  Metabolomic Diagnostics will offer a revolutionary blood test to be administered at 15 weeks into a pregnancy, which can predict with a high degree of accuracy and negligible false negatives, the risk that a woman will develop preeclampsia later in their pregnancy.  A combination of metabolites in the blood is measured and the results, along with certain clinical data are fed into a classification algorithm, which extrapolates the results. This information will allow clinicians to tailor specific medical care to patients who are at higher risk of developing pre-eclampsia.  Current work aims to validate and commercially develop the diagnostic platform and should be ready to commence a hospital later this year.",Health & Life Science Tech

1732,Zopa,"Zopa is a P2P money lending service that allows lenders and borrowers to deal directly with one another, cutting out the banks who act as middlemen. Zopa works in the following way: the company first categorizes borrower credit grades with an A*, A, B, C or Y rating; then lenders make offers that vary by money amount and time period for persons with a certain credit grade, and borrowers can then agree the aggregate offered rate. Zopa takes on such responsibilities as distributing money between parties, completing the legal paperwork, performing borrower identity/credit checks, and employing a collections agency that chases missed payments for the lender. Zopa also mitigates risk for lenders by enforcing monthly direct debit repayment, making borrowers sign a legal contract, and allowing lenders to lend small chunks of money to individual borrowers (i.e. someone lending Â£1000 would have their money spread across say, 100 borrowers). The company itself makes money by charging a fixed fee for borrowers and a 1% annual fee for lenders. Zopa has received public acclaim as well, having been awarded CNET Technology Awards' 2006 Internet Innovation of the Year, the 2007 Webby Award for Best Banking/Bill-Paying Website, the 2008 Webby Award for Financial Services, the Banker 2007 Award for Best Internet Project and Moneywise 2009 Awards for Best Customer Service and Best Personal Loan.

The company simplifies the manual application process to one that is 100% online and automated. Businesses can use their business data to submit an application online and receive an answer in minutes instead of waiting weeks and filling out numerous forms like traditional lending methods. Businesses can access ongoing lines of credit up to $250,000. Kabbage leverages business data generated such as revenue, accounting data, business transactions, shipping data, social media and other sources to understand a business’s overall health and calculate credit lines throughout the customer lifecycle. The company began serving online merchants in 2011 and extended its automated lending platform to all small businesses – online and brick-and-mortar – in February 2014. In November 2013, Kabbage expanded its business to mobile with an iOS and Android app that enables users to apply or access their funds from their smartphones. Kabbage used to provide a consumer lending product, Karrot, but it is no longer available. Kabbage expanded the application of its platform in March 2015 by licensing the data and technology platform to power lending for other organizations. The company was named one of Forbes magazine’s Most Promising Companies list for the second year in a row. Kabbage further extended its lending reach in May 2015 with the announcement of the new Kabbage Card, which gives businesses the ability to pay for items at the point of sale with a purchasing card tied to their Kabbage account. Kabbage also collaborated with MasterCard in May 2015 to make Kabbage’s data and technology platform available through MasterCard’s network of acquirers. In August 2015, Kabbage was named the 36th fastest-growing private company in America on the Inc. 500 list. In October 2015, Kabbage completed a Series E funding round of $135 million led by Reverence Capital Partners. Holland’s ING, Spain’s Santander (via InnoVentures, Santander's venture capital arm); and Canada’s Scotiabank also participated in the round. Kabbage also announced a strategic partnership with ING to deliver instant capital to small businesses throughout Spain. In June 2016, Kabbage was named to CNBC's annual Disruptor 50 list of the most forward-thinking and ambitious companies that are revolutionizing industries and markets worldwide. Two months later, Kabbage was named to the Inc. 500 list of the country's fastest-growing private companies for the second year in a row In August 2016, Kroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA) upgraded and affirmed ratings on Class A2-2 Certificates issued by Kabbage Funding 2014-1 Resecurization Trust. The certificates were upgraded from BBB+(sf) to A-(sf) based on structural improvements to the transaction’s concentration requirements and the existence of more historical data relating to Kabbage’s collateral. KBRA also affirmed the ratings on the Class B2A Certificates of BB-(sf), Class B2B Certificates of BB-(sf) and Class B2C Certificates of B+(sf), which were initially rated in November 2015.

History has shown that most professional mutual fund managers cannot match the long-term performance of index funds, much less beat them. In addition, many funds charge high fees and generate massive turnover, such that the average fund under performs the S&P 500 Index by 3% per year.

The few firms that use software are using expensive legacy systems. This inefficient cost structure causes traditional firms to overcharge their customers and to save money in customer service. This is why in 2014 they started NoviCap and have built their technology from the ground up with the customer in mind. The end result is an invoice finance facility where every step is easy, fast and transparent.

782,Afrimarket,"Afrimarket is an innovative Money Transfer operator with a cash-to-goods approach, helping African migrants remit dedicated funds to Africa at a fraction of current money transfer costs. Afrimarket enables African migrants to send dedicated funds to their families back home at a fraction of the price of traditional money transfer giants. In 2012, African migrant workers sent nearly US $60 billion in remittances to support their families. African migrants face two challenges when remitting funds. - First, the cost. Africans pay more to send money home than any other migrant group. In fact, the average cost of sending money to Africa is almost 12 percent, much higher than the global average of 8.96 percent. - Second, part of the money that manages to make it home is not used for its intended purpose – rather, it can be diverted or lost to other needs deemed by the recipient to be more important. Afrimarket allows migrants to remit dedicated funds at specific point of sales where they can buy food, medicine or pay for tuition fees. Cutting out money transfer agents and other middlemen in favor of mobile phones, the Afrimarket platform is able to drive down fees for remittance senders, and thereby increase the amount of money that reaches the intended recipient. To send dedicated funds via Afrimarket, migrant workers simply need to log into their online Afrimarket account (soon to expand to brick-and-mortar agents in sending countries), enter their payment information, specify the recipients’ phone number, choose a specific point-of-sale for funds to be received, and click send. What distinguishes Afrimarket from other mobile remittance platforms is what happens on the recipient end. Through the platform, money is transferred from the sender's Afrimarket digital account in the form of credit (rather than cash), which can only be redeemed at designated point-of-sales, and used for specific purposes.",FinTech

Omise now operates in Thailand, Japan, and Singapore. In Thailand, online stores are still striving to have a proper payment solution because applying and implementing has never been simple and smooth. All of the major PSP’s require cumbersome documentation to apply; monthly commitments, high transaction fees and all take considerable amount of time to gain approval. Additionally, there is no good online API documentation or sandbox to test. Thus, stores drive their business by offline payment methods such as ATMs, Banks or online banking. Once shoppers have made their transactions, they have to send a proof of payment to there store via email or other social network channels. Since there is no payment notification, the store has to check the transaction manually which delays the delivery time and increases the chance of fraud. This fraud may occur by shoppers’ photo shopping their proof of payment. Since a reliable, simple and smooth online payment system has been lacking in Thailand, Omise.co founder, Jun Hasegawa and co-founder Ezra Don Harinsut, recognized the need to bridge the gap between stores and shoppers.

Luke was having a hard time getting his crews to send him the documentation he needed for each site, including pictures, notes about certain issues, and more. He searched high and low all over the interwebs to try and find an app or a software that did what he wanted, but alas, there was no such program. That’s when Luke said fr*ck it and decided he would just make it himself—and by make it himself, they mean he hired someone to do it. Luke spent some time with a local development shop nailing down the specifics of what he wanted for his family’s business and in no time, the first version of CompanyCam was born. And it was magical. Well, not really. It got the job done, but it still needed some work. That’s where Chad comes in.

He went to Omaha Startup Weekend and it was there that he met Chad Wilken. It was dev at first sight. They hit it off and Chad was quickly hired to develop the app into something magnificent. Not long after, the development team continued to grow and more and more wizards were brought on to make the app more intuitive, better looking, and overall more impressive.

3464,Chip Path Design Systems,"Chip Path™ Design Systems, a chip architecture and assembly company, announces the industry's first device-mapping tools and IP directory for FPGA front-end design with free and pay by credit card use models. Using only a web browser with no software installation required, the Chip Path portal and IP directory are freely accessible from anywhere in the world. For the first time, designers can design, research, compare and plug-and-play hundreds of IP blocks and search, select and compare side by side FPGA devices across multiple vendors. Chip Path has aggregated 6,000 intellectual property (IP) cores from over 400 vendors for use in FPGA mapping and estimation. The result is the ability to significantly reduce design costs and speed design time by providing technical and business information in one graphical and easy-to-use system. The portal features devices from Altera Corp., Lattice Semiconductor Corp., Microsemi Corp. (Actel), Xilinx Inc. and Achronix. Over 29 FPGA families are supported, representing 430 bases with over 2,000 package combinations and over 11,000 part numbers and speed grades. Real-time inventory and part number purchasing can be done directly from the website, linking distributors such as Arrow, Avnet, Digi-Key, Mouser and others. FPGA and FPASSP: Fast track from chip architecture to implementation Chip Path has created a new paradigm in FPGA device mapping technology serving both FPGA and ASSP. To improve FPGA efficiency, the trend has been to hard diffuse large SoC-style blocks alongside the more expensive FPGA fabric. The FPASSP (Field Programmable ASSP) represents a hybrid of the flexibility of an FPGA with embedded ASSP hard-diffused partitions. Using Chip Path's unique system, architects can design chips using semantic or placeholder IP, directly using vendor IP or their own internal IP to create, assemble and test economic viability of their designs, reducing risk, cost and time to market. Chip Path can map pure FPGA devices as well as those with complex SoC style partitions. Now entire systems can be efficiently mapped onto one die. Chip Path's FPASSP portal supports SmartFusion™, SmartFusion 2™, Zynq®-7000, Arria® V SE/SX and Arria® 10 SE/SX. ''For the first time customers will have access to vendor-neutral tools that provide impartial FPGA mapping from the four major vendors and Achronix,'' said J. George Janac, CEO of Chip Path Design Systems. ''As FPGAs have embraced the latest 28nm nodes much faster than ASICs or ASSPs, they have increasingly become a competitive solution for box, board, and systems designers.'' The Chip Path Portal provides the industry's first worldwide subscription-based usage system using both free and advanced pay features with secure credit card processing. The self-service portal allows users to aggregate data on all available IP and FPGAs from vendors, removing problems associated with limited data access. Users are assured to receive the most accurate and competitive information available. FPGA and FPASSP: Architectural creation by catalog models Design entry is simple and flexible. FPGA Search can be run from a single form with as little as six resource numbers. Chip Path search tools also offer the option to import vendor synthesis and mapping results allowing development board-based RTL designs to be mapped onto much cheaper devices for production. Chip Path's ChipArchitect tool uses built-in semantic models and can generate over 1.8M end-to-end I/O channel and core models with either a hard embedded IP or FPGA fabric implementation. Additional tools provide the added flexibility of adding blocks either directly from an external vendor IP catalog or from an internal IP catalog. Pre-RTL blocks can be defined using LUT, BRAM, DSP and other resources. ChipArchitect provides a complete array of input options and outputs the best choices of devices across the industry for its customers.  The Chip Path FPGA portal has a free use starter model. The FPGA search tool and IP directory can be used free of charge without a login, allowing mapping of devices and IP directory search. Free use of the FPGA ChipArchitect tool is also provided, but login is required. A $79/year membership provides added device access to 28nm FPGA devices as well as new 40nm/65nm devices from Lattice Semiconductor and Microsemi. Full FPGA package selection, SERDES mapping, speed grade analysis, real-time inventory and distributor ordering start at $199/week. A similar package that adds FPASSP devices is $299/week. In addition, 20nm/22nm pre-production device models are directly available from Chip Path for a monthly subscription fee. Availability The Chip Path Portal is now available at www.ChipPath.com. The worldwide design community is invited to visit the portal, view our technical video demonstration and explore the free resources and available services.",ConstructionTech

4008,PlanetReuse,"PlanetReuse (PR) was founded on a simple, but revolutionary idea: make reclaimed building material reuse easier and more people will do it.  PlanetReuse is a reclaimed materials consultancy and brokerage firm. PR expertly matches reclaimed materials with designers, builders, and owners to save projects money, serve LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) efforts and sustain the planet. PR grew over 300% last year. Having encouraged and coordinated the reuse of building materials for hundreds of commercial jobs, our work has made us a national leader in commercial green building. After spending the last four years building a reclaimed building materials network to serve the commercial building industry, PlanetReuse is now launching an effort to bring this monumental opportunity to every day citizens across the U.S. Our aim is to make reclaimed building materials top-of-mind and easy-to-access so both commercial and residential building owners who need materials for a construction project, consider 'used' materials before 'new.’ And when it’s time for demolition or renovation we want reuse to be THE obvious alternative to the landfill. To increase awareness of, and access to, reused/surplus residential building materials, we will soon introduce PlanetReuse Marketplace (PRM). PRM will be a national, social media-enabled website that allows customers to locate, view, share and eventually buy inventory from the roughly 1,100 for-profit and non-profit reuse centers in the U.S. (e.g. Habitat for Humanity ReStore, Chicago's Rebuilding Exchange) that sell used and surplus materials at 40-60% off the price of new. Reuse centers will populate the site with their inventories via our proprietary technology, InvenQuery, which uses a mobile phone application to instantly -- and in a single work-flow -- post new inventory online upon intake and remove it at point-of-sale.  The InvenQuery technology platform, which incorporates e-commerce and social media marketing, has been designed in collaboration with reuse centers nationwide and will fundamentally change the trajectory of reclaimed building material sales.  The reuse center industry is growing 15-20% per year, yet straw polls suggest only 2 of 10 Americans are even aware of reuse centers.  Furthermore, they sell less than 5% of inventory online, using a clunky manual posting process for Craigslist or Facebook. PRM, powered by InvenQuery will change this. We will bring connection, convenience, awareness and credibility to the reuse industry, ultimately making it as easy to shop online for reclaimed building materials as it is to shop for new materials from Home Depot or Lowe’s.",ConstructionTech

3426,Sensoterra,"Sensoterra develops wireless, low cost soil moisture sensors to help growers and landscapers save water and effectively irrigate plants and crops. The world's fresh water supplies are steadily dwindling. Agriculture consumes 70% of the world’s water supply to provide food for 7.5 billion people, yet it is far behind when it comes to embracing digital solutions to solve problems of efficiency and quality in the production of food. Less than 1% of all growers use sensors to understand crops condition and needs. As a result, almost all growers over-irrigate by up to 60%, wasting money, precious water and damaging healthy soils. Dwindling freshwater supplies not only affect agricultural irrigation practices, but directly impacts local communities and cities that share in freshwater consumption. Drought and increasing water scarcity is quickly felt in metropolitan areas. Thankfully, efforts can be taken to better manage irrigation of public green-spaces, preemptively preventing over irrigation and water waste. Our goal is to support growers and landscapers get the most ‘value per drop’ while eliminating wasteful watering. The sensors enable growers to achieve a reduction of water use of up to 30%.",ConstructionTech

WOOD-SKIN shows its potential at first as a cladding system for walls, ceilings and complex volumes, but also as a system for exterior facades. It also evolves as a smart solution for covering existing volumes and furniture, volumes that can be self supporting and fold in shape much like rigid origami, complex shapes designed all around the world with contemporary software and then often hard to built with traditional techniques. The Wood-Skin process transforms rigid materials into sheets of a “programmable” composite with the potential to be coded and to obtain a specific form thanks to the milling process, which allows the panel to bend along the “digital hinges”, just like an origami would. From the at state the materials evolve into the three-dimensional state where they can take endless shapes and functions without loose the original strength. WOOD-SKIN gave, at first, organic shapes capabilities to wooden panels, in many different aesthetics thanks to the various range of wooden veneers. Today, thanks to virtuous partnerships with selected Italian and international brands, it is a process applied to many different rigid materials such as aluminum, solid surface or HPL, giving them a new three-dimensional life.",ConstructionTech

781,CG Visions,"CG Visions was established in 2000 by Dave Bozell, then a professor in the Department of Computer Graphics at Purdue University. Bozell’s knowledge and experience was sought for assistance in integrating light gauge steel panelization software with an existing manufacturing line. After this first successful consultation and integration, word spread and demand grew. Between 2000 and 2002, Bozell asked Cory Shively, Scott Schultz, and Tim Beckman to join his growing start-up. The partners brought a new mix of ideas and experiences in the digital media and construction fields. Hard work, initiative, and problem solving drove the team. As they built their business, they endured offices with no heat where they swapped the space heater after each song on the radio; a lack of parking, so they shuffled cars every 2 hours to dodge parking tickets; and leaky roofs which claimed more than a few monitors. CG Visions was helping clients across the eastern United States with projects such as apartments, dormitories, and hotels. Leveraging the benefits of Building Information Modeling (BIM) allowed clients to gain more than they could from the traditional 2D process of design and construction. In 2001, after the disaster of 9/11 and a decline in light gauge steel construction, CG Visions saw an opportunity to expand into the residential building market. With the knowledge of construction trends and technology, CG Visions began helping residential builders across the nation understand and adapt to new technologies allowing them to realize savings and efficiencies through BIM. In the process, CG Visions realized that residential builders had specific technology needs that weren’t being met by current tools on the market. The team began developing products and establishing key partnerships that would help them serve their clients better. Gone are the days of space heaters, parking tickets, and leaky roofs, but hard work, initiative, and problem solving have persisted. As the company continues to expand, CG Visions strives to extend their values to both clients and partners alike.",ConstructionTech

Visualizations occupy an increasingly important place in architecture and its related industries, where such packaged services are becoming par for the course. Although the relatively young market has historically been driven by the architecture industry, construction companies, developers, and product designers are poised to grab a greater share in the coming years, as the multi-million industry is expected to grow at an annual rate of 35.6%. Targeting this growing demand, RenderThat allows businesses to access a wellspring of talent worldwide through its contest-hosting platform. Taking its cues from the popular ''crowdsourcing'' model, RenderThat allows businesses in need of rendering services to post design brief identifying their needs, upload any necessary files, and wait for the submissions by 3D designers to roll in. RenderThat, however, diverges from this model at many important junctures. Unlike other design marketplaces, the site is devoted exclusively to 3D rendering and related services that have a steep learning curve. According to cofounder David Wischniewski, ''Establishing a baseline skill set effectively raises the bar on the quality of submissions. Sourcing from a global group of individuals who are up on the latest softwares and techniques, allows businesses to focus on their core activities while delivering a superior product to the client and achieving their own marketing goals.'' Secondly, the site offers unique incentives to designers. Contests hosted on RenderThat provide compensation not only to the winning designer, but to the second and third runners-up. In addition, the site's founders plan to add a number of free educational and reference services to the platform, including tutorials and an online texture resource library, available to all registered users.",ConstructionTech

This decision immediately placed Dual Seal Glass as a market leader in product choice which was linked with an ethos of quality and service that has carried through to the present day. Continued expansion in sales meant a move to larger premises was needed, and in 2000 Dual Seal Glass moved to its current location at Leeds Road Huddersfield. The expansion brought with it investment in cutting and tempering facilities all of which were capable of processing the latest technology in soft coat glasses. Automated IGU production lines were next on the agenda and in 2004 the first robot line was introduced which coincided with a strategic move into the commercial insulating glass sector. Successful partnerships were developed with both European and UK manufacturers of high performance solar coated glasses, all of which remain in place today. These supply chain agreements established Dual Seal Glass as one of the UK’s most recognised independent manufacturers of commercial insulating glass units with a credibility for maintaining a progressive outlook in a very complex market. Additional bays were added in 2009 to accommodate an investment of £1.5million on automated 3210 x 6000 jumbo glass cutting equipment, followed in 2011 with a further £1.5 million investment on the latest generation of glass toughening furnaces.
